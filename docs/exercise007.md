# Exercises 007

Well done for getting this far! ðŸŽ‰

Once again, we'd like you to write your own unit tests.

Remember, there is a video on Unit Testing available here:

[Writing your own Unit Tests](https://storage.googleapis.com/tech-returners-course/JavaScript_Challenges/unit_testing.mp4)

Work through the exercises in a TDD (Test Driven Development) approach of Red -> Green -> Refactor

In these exercises you have covered forLoops, ES6 methods like .map() and .forEach(), eslint, Test Driven Development and more! 

Great work, we hope you found these exercises fun and look forward to seeing you soon. ðŸ™Œ

See [Exercise008](./exercise008-bonus-activity.md) for an optional Bonus activity!
