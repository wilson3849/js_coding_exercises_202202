# Exercises 003

Once again we have a selection of JavaScript challenges for you to work through.

1. Take a look over your _indentation_ for the previous challenges. Does everything look neat? If you right click inside your files and select **Format Document**, does VSCode make any adjustments? If so, add and commit these changes.
2. Work through the challenges in the `challenges/exercise003.js` file, adding and committing your work as you go.

NB Take a look at previous instructions for how to only run individual test files, and individual tests.

Once you have completed these challenges you can move onto the next ones: [Exercises 004 - Docs](./exercise004.md)

You're doing great! ðŸ™Œ
