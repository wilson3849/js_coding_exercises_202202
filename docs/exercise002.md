# Exercises 002

These challenges encourage you to keep on practicing your JavaScript skills!

1. Run `npm run eslint` in your terminal. Make sure you fix any linting errors from the previous challenges.
2. If you made any changes in the previous 2 steps, make sure to commit them.
3. Take a look at the `test/exercise002.test.js` file where you will see the tests for this set of challenges.
4. Complete the functions in `challenges/exercise002.js` in order to make the tests pass. Remember that you can pause tests or run only specific tests - see the main [README.md](../README.md) file for details.
5. If you want to only run a specific test _file_ (which you probably do want to do, since using .only only works within a single file) then go to the `package.json` file and update the `test` script section so that it looks like this:

```json
"scripts": {
    "test": "jest test/exercise002.test.js",
    "eslint": "eslint ./"
  },
```

Remember to change it back afterwards so it's running all the tests again!
